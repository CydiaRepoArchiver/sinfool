Name: Animations - Immediately OpenClose Apps iOS 10
Identifier: com.sinfool.animationsimmediatelyopencloseappsios10
Version: 0.0.1-1+debug
Description: I created this patch to mimic iOS 10's ability to stop apps from opening as soon as the home button is pressed.
 
 This was achieved by removing open/close app animations & disabling double pressing of the home button so as a result, apps won't initially open up until they've been loaded into memory but thereafter they'll open immediately.
 
 IMPORTANT: This patch will require you to use another tweak to activate the switcher (i.e. Acitvator or Tage etc) since the stock double home button press action will be disabled.

 - (for Blank Icons):  Make any safari bookmark/web clip & put it into a folder.   Enable the patch/respring.  Position surrounding icons to achieve your desired result.
 - (to Hide Apps from the HS):  Put apps in a folder & position it as the last icon on your HS.  Enable the patch/respring.

Identifier: com.sinfool.kbenableonehandedkeyboard
Version: 0.0.1-1+debug
Description: Enables iOS's hidden one handed keyboard. Swipe in from sides to activate.
 
 *Only works on 4.7" (iP6/S) & 5.5" (iP6/S+) devices.
 
 NOTE:  The activation gesture conflicts with Swipe Selection's "Whole keyboard (Default)" & "Everything but the spacebar" swipe settings so either manually enable/disable Swipe Selection via "Triple Tap" to retain those swipe area gestures or use "Just the spacebar" which still works fine.

Name: KB - Force Keyboard Type
Identifier: com.sinfool.kbforcekeyboardtype
Version: 0.0.1-1+debug
Description: Forces the keyboard to use a specific type.  Some examples are listed below.
 
 0 = Standard (i.e. no extra period key)
 1 = No emoji key
 2 = Open w/@123 KB, no emoji key
 3 = No space bar/dictation key (replaced by ".", "/" and ".com" keys)
 4 = # pad
 5 = # pad + "+*#" key
 7 = No dictation key (adds "@" and "." keys)
 8 = # pad + "." key
 9 = No return key (replaced by "@" and "#" keys)
 10 = Adds "." key and changes "Return" to "Go"
 
 NOTE:  This may be more useful on a per app basis (i.e. you always want a specific KB for a specific app).  If this is the case, I suggest replicating this patch for said app.

Identifier: com.sinfool.lowpowermodeneverautolock
Version: 0.0.1-1+debug
Description: Disables/sets auto-lock duration to "Never" and disables the proximity sensor.
 
 * Useful for those who always have "Low Power Mode" enabled but don't like the 30 sec auto lock restriction.
 
 ⚠️WARNING:  This overrides auto-lock duration at all times!!! (i.e. NOT just while in low power mode so therefore the time duration at Settings>General>Auto-Lock is irrelevant). By default, this also disables the proximity sensor.  This entry was added because triggering the proximity sensor while on a phone call with the device unlocked results in the screen not waking back up therefore forcing the need for a sleep button press to dismiss this locked state.

Version: 0.0.1-1+debug
Description: Customizes the progress bar with the following options (made for landscape devices)...

This is due to portrait devices not having bookmark options etc in the nav bar. I may look for a fix in the future.
